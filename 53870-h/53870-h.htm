<h2>The Signification of Moles.</h2>
<p>A mole near either elbows, shows the person to be of an
unsteady disposition; to whom much discontent will fall in a
marriage state, no great prosperity, but disagreeable accidents;
marriage with a person will make you very unhappy and children
whose misconduct will give you much trouble.</p>
<p>A mole on the front of the left arm, between the bend of the
elbow and the shoulder, shows great fortitude, resolution,
industry and fondness of learning; but that your partner in the
marriage state, will be very unfaithful, and yeild to every new
face; not very prosperous, but much under the control of your
partner.</p>
<p>A mole on the cheek shows an industrious and ingenious
disposition; given to be rather grave, but addicted to the
pleasure, of love; and moderate success in life.</p>
<p>A mole near the side of the chin shows an amiable disposition,
industrious, ingenious, and inclined to traveling; will also be
very successful in life, loving, and have many friends.</p>
<p>If either a man or woman have a mole on the place right
against the heart, it denotes them to be undoubtedly wicked.</p>
<p>If a mole be seen on a man or woman&rsquo;s belly, it
signifies he or she to be a great eater and a glutton.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>If a man
or woman have a mole at the bottom of the belly it signifies
weakness, and to be often sick.</p>
<p>If a man has a mole on his knee, signifies he shall obtain a
comely and wealthy wife.</p>
<p>If a woman has a mole on the right knee, it signifies her to
be honest and virtuous; but if on the left, she shall have many
children.</p>
<p>If a man has a mole athwart his nose, it denotes that he will
be a great traveller.</p>
<p>A mole standing on a woman&rsquo;s nose, signifies that she
shall travel on foot through divers countries.</p>
<p>A mole on a man&rsquo;s throat, signifies that he shall become
rich.</p>
<p>If a woman has a mole on the lower jaw, it signifies she shall
lead her life in sorrow and pain of body.</p>
<p>A mole in the midst of the forehead, next the hair, denotes
the possessor to have a discourteous cruel mind, floating brain,
dull and incapable, and of unpleasant discourse? if it is of a
honey colour, the party will be beloved; if red, the possessor is
sullen and furious; if black, inexpert and wavering; if raised
like a wort, it is very fortunate, but if a woman, it shows her
to be a slut, lazy and slothful; if it appear in her forehead
black, she is treacherous and consent to evil deeds, and the
murderer of some one.</p>
<p>A mole on the right side, about the middle of the forehead
declares a man to abound in goods and benefits, by the favors and
friendships of great men; he will be loaded with offices of
command, and will be esteemed and honored; the paler the colour
the greater honour awaits him; if red he is loved by the clergy;
if black let him be aware that he does not incur the resentment
of great men; if watery, it increaseth his good fortune; a woman
having this, shall be unfortunate in all her actions; but if
black beware of her tongue.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, near the hair,
predicts misery, poverty, and abundance of tribulations to a man,
and that by means of his own misconduct; if it be either
honey-colour or red, his sorrows are somewhat lessened; if black,
he is in danger of imprisonment, but if it be as a wart his ill
fortunes are moderated; to a woman it indicates her to be needy
and poor; but if black, she will be unfortunate and unhappy in
every undertaking.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, somewhat lower than
the fore-named, fortels to the man, contentions, quarrels, and
persecutions, chiefly by reason of women; if a honey-colour these
troubles will arise from women who are your kindred; if red, by
reason of luxury; if black he will consume his estate; if like a
wart he will be martial, stout and valiant! to a woman it
generally signifieth great molestations, and little credit: she
is warned to take heed of danger arising from a licentious,
loose, and debauched carriage; of whatsoever colour it may be,
the woman shall be a loose and careless housewife, and
extravagant to an extreme.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, about the midway, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>threatens a
man with prisons, and persecutions from his superiors; if a
honey-colour, he prodigally and loftily wastes his estate; if
red, he will become poor; if black, let him beware of the warth
or malice of great men; to a woman, it threatens sorrow and
anguish, by the perfidity of some men; and if black, she will
partake of the extreme of misery.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side of the forehead, a little above the
temple, shows the man to be very malignant, and of an evil
disposition; if of a honey-colour, he shall be a hatred to his
friends; if black, he is in danger of being criminated and
branded for his falsehoods; if as a wart, his fate is mitigated;
to a woman, it signifies justification of innocence, though not
deserved? if black, she is blamed for malignity, and deserve far
more, as it represents every evil.</p>
<p>A mole appearing on the right temple, over the eye, denotes a
long life, and a good fortune; if it appears pale, or red, he is
studious; to a woman, it signifies good and happy fortunes and
marriage, as she will be of careful conduct.</p>
<p>A mole on the right temple, inclining towards the neck,
promiseth ingenuity, from whence riches will assuredly flow, as
also long life; honey-coloured or red, he shall rejoice in good
fortune; if black, he will be somewhat troubled in his affairs;
but if as a wart, he shall obtain the good things he wishes, or
sets his hand to; to a woman it promiseth goods, and long life;
she is modest, virtuous and chaste? if it appears black, it will
be an hinderance to her good fortune.&nbsp; Moles like a wart,
are in general very fortunate.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side, towards the upper part of the corner
of the eye signifies great and dangerous sickness; if it is
honey, or red-colour, these misfortunes will be modified, if
black, a short life, by means of a grievous fall, or suffocation
by water or smoke; if as a wart, it denotes a good end? to a
woman, moderate health and many perplexities, loss of favour and
friends, perverse children and enemies, who will endeavour to
wrong her; if black, it foretels many miseries, and in all
probability a violent death.</p>
<p>A mole under the hollow of the right eye, by the inward part
of the nose, denotes the man to be a hasty, proud, arbitary, and
furious spirit; if it be a honey-colour, he is active and
tractable; if red he is a rough-hewn being and wranglesome; if
black, seditious and stubborn; to a woman, let the colour be what
it will, it signifies her to be proud, satirical, impertinent,
conceited, a fomenter of mischief, one who will domineer over her
husband and every body else, and will ruin herself by such means;
and her misfortunes will gain no pity from others, as her conduct
is generally contemptuous.</p>
<p>If either man or woman have a mole on the neck, it doth
promise that they will become rich.</p>
<p>If in either a man or woman&rsquo;s hand a mole appears, it
denotes great prosperity, and enjoyment of children.</p>
<p>If either a man or woman have a mole on the right breast it
threatens they shall be much armed by poverty.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>A mole
on the left side of the stomach denotes luxury.</p>
<p>A mole on the left shoulder, near the arm, denotes the person
given to quarrels, hatred and strife.</p>
<p>A mole on the middle of the stomach denotes dangerous
desease.</p>
<p>A mole on the left corner of the eye, denotes the party
subject to melancholly.</p>
<p>A mole on the left cheek denotes poverty.</p>
<p>A mole on the tip of the right ear, threatens the party with
drowning.</p>
<p>A mole on the bottom of the nostril, foretells the man or
woman fortunate or unlucky.</p>
<p>A mole on the left side of the belly, denotes afflictions and
crosses.</p>
<p>A mole on the right foot, denotes the party to be endued with
wisdom and eloquence.</p>
<p>A mole on the groin or on the right side, denotes good fortune
but on the left the contrary.</p>
<p>A mole on the eye-brow, denotes speedy marriage and a good
husband.</p>
<p>A mole on the right side of the stomach, denotes the party to
suffer much by the means of a woman.</p>
<p>A mole under the left arm-pit shows untimely death.</p>
<p>A mole on each side of the neck, opposite, threatens the
person with the loss of life.</p>
<p>One on the centre of the breast, with a black hair, shows the
party given to poetry.</p>
<p>One on the hollow of the right signifies the party to be
furious.</p>
<p>A woman having a mole on her chin, will be a great fall
back.</p>
<p>He that has one on the left cheeks near the chin, will be a
man of honour.</p>
<h2>The art of Telling Fortunes by Dice.</h2>
<p>This is a certain and innocent way of finding out common
occurences about to take place.&nbsp; Take three dice, shake them
well in the box with your left hand, and then cast them out on a
board or table, on which you have previously drawn a circle with
chalk.</p>
<p>Three&mdash;a pleasing surprise.</p>
<p>Four&mdash;a disagreeable one.</p>
<p>Five&mdash;a stranger who will prove a friend.</p>
<p>Six&mdash;loss of property.</p>
<p>Seven&mdash;undeserved scandal.</p>
<p>Eight&mdash;merited reproach.</p>
<p>Nine&mdash;a wedding.</p>
<p>Ten&mdash;a christening, at which some important event will
occur.</p>
<p>Eleven&mdash;a death that concerns you.</p>
<p>Twelve&mdash;a letter speedily.</p>
<p>Thirteen&mdash;Tears and sighs.</p>
<p>Fourteen&mdash;beware that you are not drawn into some trouble
or plot by a secret enemy.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Fifteen&mdash;immediate prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>Sixteen&mdash;a pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Seventeen&mdash;you will either be on the water, or have
dealings with those belonging to it, to your advantage.</p>
<p>Eighteen&mdash;a great profit, rise in life, or some most
desireable good will happen almost immediately; for the answers
to the dice are fulfilled within nine days.&nbsp; To show the
same number twice at one trial, shows news from abroad, be the
number what it may.&nbsp; If the dice roll over the circle the
number thrown goes for nothing, but the occurrence shows sharp
words; and if they fall on the floor it is blows; in throwing out
the dice, if one remain on the top of the other, it is a present
of which I would have them take care.</p>
<h2>Dominoes.</h2>
<p>Lay them with their faces on the table, and shuffle them; then
draw one and see the number.</p>
<p>Double-six&mdash;receiving a handsome sum of money.</p>
<p>Six-five&mdash;going to a public amusement.</p>
<p>Six-four&mdash;law suits.</p>
<p>Six-three&mdash;ride in a coach.</p>
<p>Six-two&mdash;a present of clothing.</p>
<p>Six-one&mdash;you will soon perform a friendly action.</p>
<p>Six-blank&mdash;guard against scandal, or yon will suffer by
your inattention.</p>
<p>Double-five&mdash;a new abode to your advantage.</p>
<p>Five-four&mdash;a fortunate speculation.</p>
<p>Five-three&mdash;a visit from a superior.</p>
<p>Five-two&mdash;a water party.</p>
<p>Five-one&mdash;a love intrigue.</p>
<p>Five-blank&mdash;a funeral, but not of a relation.</p>
<p>Double-four&mdash;drinking liquor at a distance.</p>
<p>Four-three&mdash;a false alarm at your house.</p>
<p>Four-two&mdash;beware of thieves or swindlers.&nbsp; Ladies
take notice of this; it means more than it says.</p>
<p>Four-one&mdash;trouble from creditors.</p>
<p>Four-blank&mdash;receive a letter from an angry friend.</p>
<p>Double-three&mdash;sudden wedding, at which you will be vexed,
and by which you will lose a friend.</p>
<p>Three-two&mdash;buy no lottery tickets, nor enter into any
game of chance, or you will assuredly lose.</p>
<p>Three-one&mdash;a great discovery at hand.</p>
<p>Three-blank&mdash;an illegitimate child.</p>
<p>Double-two&mdash;you will be plagued with a jealous
partner.</p>
<p>Two-one&mdash;you will mortgage or pledge some property very
soon.</p>
<p>Double-one&mdash;you will soon find something to your
advantage, in the street or road.</p>
<p>Double-blank&mdash;the worst presage in all the set of
Dominoes; you will soon meet trouble from a quarter quite
unprepared.</p>
<p>It is useless for persons to draw more than three dominoes at
one time of trial, or in one and the same week, as they will only
deceive themselves; shuffle the dominoes each time of choosing;
to draw the same dominoe twice, makes the answer together.</p>

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
